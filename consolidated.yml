  Summary: The implementation uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is efficient
    in both time and space. Memory usage is primarily due to the boolean array of
    size 'limit + 1', which is necessary for marking primes. This approach is optimal
    for generating primes up to a moderate limit. Potential improvements could include
    using a bit set or segmented sieve for very large limits to reduce memory usage.
