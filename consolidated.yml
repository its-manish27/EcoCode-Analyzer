  Summary: The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm used here is optimal for generating
    prime numbers, with a time complexity of O(n log log n) and a space complexity
    of O(n). Memory usage is efficient, but depending on the limit, the boolean array
    can consume significant space. The nested loop structure for marking non-prime
    numbers runs well within expected time limits, though initializing the array uses
    extra memory.
