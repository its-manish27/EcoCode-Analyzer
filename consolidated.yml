  memory_usage_point: 8
  time_efficiency_point: 9
  Summary: The code utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which is efficient
    in both time and space for generating prime numbers. Memory usage is primarily
    due to the boolean array, which scales linearly with the input limit. While this
    approach is optimal for relatively small limits, for very large limits, memory
    could become a concern. The time complexity is O(n log log n), making it highly
    efficient for finding primes. The main area of concern is the memory usage for
    very high limits, especially in large-scale applications.
