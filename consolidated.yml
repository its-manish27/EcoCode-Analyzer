primeNumber.java:
  memory_usage_point: 8
  time_efficiency_point: 9
  Summary: The code effectively uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which has
    a time complexity of O(n log log n), making it quite efficient for generating
    primes. Memory usage is decent, utilizing a boolean array of size (limit + 1),
    leading to O(n) space complexity. The only area for improvement could be reducing
    the size of the array by only storing relevant prime flags. Overall, both memory
    and time complexity utilization are good, with minor adjustments possible.
