primeNumber.java:
  memory_usage_point: 8
  time_efficiency_point: 9
  Summary: The code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is efficient in
    both time and space for generating prime numbers. Memory usage is primarily due
    to the boolean array marking prime numbers, which is optimal for this approach.
    However, the memory efficiency could be improved by using a bitset if the limit
    is significantly large, as it consumes less memory than a boolean array. The time
    complexity is O(n log log n), which is appropriate for the input size being tested.
