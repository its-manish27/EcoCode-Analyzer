  Summary: The code implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm efficiently with
    a time complexity of O(n log log n) and uses a boolean array of size 'limit +
    1' for marking primes, which can be memory intensive for very large limits. The
    only potential area for improvement could be the use of optimized space by storing
    primes up to the square root of 'limit' and marking multiples accordingly, but
    this is often balanced by the algorithm's time efficiency.
