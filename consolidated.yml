FactorialCalculator.java:
  Summary: The code efficiently calculates the factorial of a number using an iterative
    approach, which is better for memory usage than a recursive method. The use of
    a long data type for the factorial result ensures that larger values are handled,
    but it may still overflow for large integers. The infinite loop for user input
    does not consume excessive memory, and input validation is in place. Optimizations
    for handling really large factorials could be considered if necessary.
